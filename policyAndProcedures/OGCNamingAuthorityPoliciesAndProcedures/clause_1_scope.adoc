== Scope

The OGC Naming Authority (OGC-NA) controls the assignment of OGC Names to resources of interest in geographic information infrastructures. In the terminology defined in ISO 19135, OGC-NA is the Control Body for the register of OGC Names. This document describes the framework of documents, registers and other resources required for OGC-NA to execute that role.

The scope of the resources that may be identified with OGC Names is indicated by the set of items in the register http://www.opengis.net/register/ogc-na/type.
