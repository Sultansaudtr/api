== Scope

An OGC name is required for ontology resources published by OGC. This includes OWL ontologies, classes and properties.

NOTE: This set of names is intended to be used for ‘T-box’ ontology elements. ‘A-box’ ontology elements, and supporting elements such as functions and rules, are identified with /def/ identifiers, as described in http://www.opengis.net/doc/def-names-1
