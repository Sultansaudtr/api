[big]*i.     Abstract*

A wide variety of sensors have historically been used to collect geospatial data. In order to enable systems to transform the data collected by the sensors into observations that can be processes and exploited, it is often necessary to understand the characteristics of the sensors. Unfortunately, to date there has not been an industry-wide open register of sensor models and their components. To address this issue, the 2018 Orleans Technical Committee passed a motion for the OGC Naming Authority (OGC-NA)  to establish a sensor model register.

The motion passed by the 2018 Orleans Technical Committee (TC) meeting read as follows: "The D&I DWG recommends that the OGC Naming Authority consider a mechanism to allow the creation of a well-defined, on-line registry capability to support registers which are recommended by a SWG or DWG. These need to be standardized and publicized in a machine-readable form with persistent identifiers. Register management will be within the scope of the OGC Naming Authority.Â  A workflow/approval mechanism for creating and updating a Register needs to also be defined. The DWG recommends the first register considered for this registry is the Sensor Model and parameters  in order to take it under the control of a standards body".

This document presents OGC policy on the registration of sensor models and their parameters. A sensor model register provides an authoritative lookup of identifiers of sensor models and their associated components such as sensor properties, transformation polynomials, and so on.

[big]*iii.   Preface*

This document specifies a rule for constructing OGC names that may be used for identifying definitions of sensor models and their parameters. This document is formally a profile of the OGC policy 'OGC-NA Name type specification - definitions: Part 1 - basic name' (OGC 09-048r5).
